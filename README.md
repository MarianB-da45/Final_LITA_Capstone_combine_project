# Final_LITA_Capstone_Excel_SQL_PowerBI_project

## My final project for LITA  Data Analysis with the Incubator International HUB- August to November 2024

### Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
- In this project, I was tasked with the duty of  analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.
- The first thing I did was to explore the sales data to uncover key insights.
- The second step is to clean the data.
- In Excel data cleaning involves a series of steps to ensure that your dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
- key steps for cleaning data in Excel:
1. Remove Duplicates
   ###	Why: Duplicate rows can skew your analysis.
   ###	How:
    -	Select the range of data or the entire worksheet.
    -	Go to the Data tab on the ribbon.
    -	Click Remove Duplicates.
    -	Select the columns you want to check for duplicates and click OK.
    -	Excel will inform you how many duplicates were removed.

-  such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.

### Instructions:
1. Excel:
 - Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.

 - Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.

- Create any other interesting report

2. SQL:
Hint - You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and validate your queries.
- Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
- retrieve the total sales for each product category.
- find the number of sales transactions in each region.
- find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
- calculate total revenue per product.
- calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
- find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
- identify products with no sales in the last quarter.

3.  Power BI
- Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL.
- The dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.
  
### Project 2: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

### Summary:
 - This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription 
   types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI dashboard that presents your analysis.
Instructions:
1. Excel:
- Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
- Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types.
- Create any other interesting reports.

2. SQL:
 - Hint - You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write.
 - And validate your queries . 

Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions. 
- retrieve the total number of customers from each region. 
- find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
- find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months. 
- calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
- find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- calculate total revenue by subscription type.
- find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
- find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.

3. Power BI:    
            
- Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments,
- cancellations, and
- subscription trends.
- Include slicers for interactive analysis.
